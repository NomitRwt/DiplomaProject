Diploma Project

The script used in the project is available as a .py file in the repository. The script is also divided into three parts according to the dataset being used. Three input datasets used in the repository are:

1. Benchmark dataset used in [3]
http://redwood-data.org/indoor/

2. Two scans for ITC building Enschede for understanding manuel registration

3. A self generated point cloud via structure through motion.
