# Point Cloud Data Handling using Open3D

## Problem Statement:

Handling point cloud data have many challenges due to its large size. In this project student would demonstrate use of Open3D package for efficient point cloud data visualisation, basic pre-processing (e.g. voxel down sampling) and processing steps (e.g. registering two point clouds) etc.

## Project Questions:

1. Popular projects for point cloud handling?<br />
[awesome-point-cloud-processing](https://github.com/mmolero/awesome-point-cloud-processing)<br />
[awesome-point-cloud-analysis](https://github.com/Yochengliu/awesome-point-cloud-analysis)

2. How to analyse the data structures for point cloud, mesh and rgbd images?

3. Complexity/Cost of the algorithms?

4. Parallelization and how is it implemented?

5. Standard implementations to judge these libraries? In other words is that implementation fair to judge the quality of both?

6. How does limitations of user hardware effects these process?

## Proposed Methodology:

The proposed work would consists of following steps:

1. Reading Point Cloud data in different formats and from various sources.
2. Visualisation
3. Pre-processing
4. Co â€“Registration of two point clouds

## Dataset /Field work:

The benchmark datasets and sample data set freely available [2][3][4] would be used and no field work is required.
