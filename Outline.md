# Point Cloud Data Handling using Open3D

## Problem Statement:

Handling point cloud data have many challenges due to its large size. In this project student would demonstrate use of Open3D package for efficient point cloud data visualisation, basic pre-processing (e.g. voxel down sampling) and processing steps (e.g. registering two point clouds) etc.

## Research Questions:

0 Popular related open source projects/libraries?

0.1 What are different formats?

0.1.1 How do point cloud and mesh compare to other formats?

0.1.2 Differences in other formats, can we structure/characterise them?

0.1.3 Discussion on formats by popular scanners or format and scanners specifics?

0.1.4 Inputting scanner specific formats in open3d?

1 What is upper and lower limits of the file sizes (largest 3d point clouds) available as open source, how much can the library consume?

2 How does the library input the point cloud?

3 Efficiency in-

3.1 Rendering (downsampling, point splats comparison, are they at all related?)

4 What are the preprocessing methods existing in literature?

4.1 Preprocssing methods implemented in library?

4.2 Complexity/Cost of the algorithms?

4 Parallelization and how is it implemented?

5 Whether are there standard implementations through which we can compare the performance of these libraries or in other words is that implementation fair to judge the quality of both.

6 How does limitations of user hardware effects these process?

## Proposed Methodology:

The proposed work would consists of following steps:

1. Reading Point Cloud data in different formats and from various sources.
2. Visualisation
3. Pre-processing
4. Co â€“Registration of two point clouds

## Dataset /Field work:

The benchmark datasets and sample data set freely available [2][3][4] would be used and no field work is required.
