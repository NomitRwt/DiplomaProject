# Point Cloud Data Handling using Open3D

## Problem Statement:

Handling point cloud data have many challenges due to its large size. In this project student would demonstrate use of Open3D package for efficient point cloud data visualisation, basic pre-processing (e.g. voxel down sampling) and processing steps (e.g. registering two point clouds) etc.

## Proposed Methodology:

The proposed work would consists of following steps:

1. Reading Point Cloud data in different formats and from various sources.
2. Visualisation
3. Pre-processing
4. Co â€“Registration of two point clouds

## Dataset /Field work:

The benchmark datasets and sample data set freely available [2][3][4] would be used and no field work is required.
